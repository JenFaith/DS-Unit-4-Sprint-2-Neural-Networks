    "**Input Layer:** ` The input layer of a neural network consists of the data variables you are trying to classify. It assigns weights to each variable (if there are weights) and then directs the data variables to neurons in either a hidden layer or the output layer.e`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden Layer:** `Hidden layers are used as an extra way of adding learning accuracy when data variables are not linearly separable. By linearly separable, I mean when two data variables, say x and y, can clearly be split into separate sections without overlap. The geometrically rigorous way of describing this would be to say that the intersection of the convex hull of each variable category is empty. But back to hidden layers. I kind of think of these hidden layers as like the middle chapters of a choose your own adventure book. They add more complexity and options for how data will ultimately be classified. Each hidden layer looks at a piece of the data you are feeding it, and then gives an output to the following layer. This allows the neural network to be more precise in its classifications. `\n",

    "**Neuron:** `Neurons (also called nodes) are mathematical structures designed to mimic the biological structure of a neuron. In basic terms, neurons are mathematical functions that accept numerical data inputs, take the sum of inputs (along with their weight and any existing biases), run this sum through an activation function, and give an output. The most basic type of a neuron is a perceptron which are neurons/nodes with only two potential outputs.`\n",

    "**Activation Function:** `Activation functions are the brilliant way that neurons decide how to output data. Essentially, your neuron holds an activation function that the data is fed through. The sigmoid function is often used. If the data output is above a certain threshold (for example 0.6 or 0.8), the neuron gives one output. Some activation functions like the linear activation function (A=cx) allow for multiple outputs while others like the sigmoid function just allow for a 0 or 1 output. Others like the softmax function are able to classify an input into multiple categories.\n",
